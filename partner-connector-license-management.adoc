= Connector License Management for Partners

== Introduction

With DevKit 3.8, MuleSoft partners can manage their connectorâ€™s license natively with DevKit, ensuring only paid customers are using the connector.

Partners that have built a MuleSoft Certified Connector can give potential customers the chance to build a Mule application with their connector and test it on the Mule ESB bundled with Anypoint Studio. However, upon deploying the Mule application with the connector, customers are prompted for the partner's generated key ensuring they possess a valid license from the partner.
