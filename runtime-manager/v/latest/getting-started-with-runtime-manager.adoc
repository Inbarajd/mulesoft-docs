Anypoint Runtime Manager provides a unified interface to manage integration applications, servers, server groups and clusters. It allows you to deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications in the cloud and on premises to servers, groups of servers, and clusters. You can create new APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on-premises applications with cloud services, manage servers and server groups on premises, and much more. With link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/download-and-launch-anypoint-studio[Anypoint Studio] – the user-friendly development tool – you can quickly build integration applications and deploy to the cloud with just a few clicks; you can then manage your applications and servers via cloudhub-at-a-glance.

cloudhub-at-a-glance is fully integrated with CloudHub, the Anypoint Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) solution from MuleSoft. CloudHub is a multi-tenanted cloud platform service running on Mule, the core runtime for the Anypoint Platform. This guide helps you learn the basics, and get started developing your first application for deploying to CloudHub.
