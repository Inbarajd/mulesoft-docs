= Managing Servers On Premises
:keywords: cloudhub, application, server, server group, on-premise, arm, runtime manager

Through the Anypoint Runtime Manager, you can set up the properties of servers, server groups, and clusters that reside on premises in your organization. Once these are set up, ARM provides a single management interface where you can manage applications running in the cloud or on servers or groups of servers that are on premises within your data center. Applications that are on premises run on Mule Runtime instance(s) on a single server or a group of servers. For cluster information, see link:/runtime-manager/creating-and-managing-clusters[Creating and Managing Clusters].

[TIP]
====
*New functionality in API Gateway 2.0*

API Gateway 2.0 supports server auto configuration and a greatly simplified deployment both for on-premises servers and for CloudHub. For details, see <<Server Tasks>>.

=== Applications Tab

An application is a Mule Application that is running on a Mule or API Gateway instance. The instance can be running CloudHub, a server in an organization, or a group of servers. For server groups, an application deployed to the group runs on every server in the group. See <<Status States>> for possible values in the *Status* column.

From the *Applications* tab, or by clicking an entry as shown, you can perform these tasks:

* <<Deploy an Application>>
* <<Start, Stop, and Delete an Application>>
* <<Manage an Application>>

=== Servers Tab

A server is a Mule or API Gateway instance that you register in the Anypoint Runtime Manager console.

image:AMC_Servers.png[AMC_Servers]

From the *Servers* tab, or by clicking an entry as shown, you can perform these tasks:

* <<Add a Server>> (registers the server with the Anypoint Runtime Manager console)
* <<Start Mule or API Gateway>>
* <<Create a Server Group>>
* <<Add a Server to a Server Group>>
* <<Stop an Application on a Server>>
* <<Remove a Server from a Server Group>>
* <<Delete a Server>>
* <<Delete a Server Group>>

== Server Tasks

=== Prerequisites

In order to perform on-premises server management, you need to have one of the following installed on your on-premises server:

 * Mule ESB – Version 3.6 or above
 * API Gateway Standalone – Version 2.0 or above

For details on configuring an API Gateway, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/configuring-an-api-gateway[Configuring an API Gateway].

[NOTE]
This document assumes that, when using the API Gateway, you are using version 2.0 or later. The steps needed to complete server tasks differ between API Gateway 2.0 and previous versions. MuleSoft recommends that you always use the latest version of API Gateway.

The following tasks let you manage the Mule servers in your organization using ARM.

Topics:

* <<Add a Server>> (registers the server with the Anypoint Runtime Manager console)
* <<Start Mule or API Gateway>>
* <<Create a Server Group>>
* <<Add a Server to a Server Group>>
* <<Stop an Application on a Server>>
* <<Remove a Server from a Server Group>>
* <<Delete a Server>>
* <<Delete a Server Group>>

=== Add a Server

To add a server:

. Go to the *Servers* tab in ARM.
. If the environment already contains servers, click *Add Server* to add an additional server.
+
The *Servers* screen displays a command that you must run from each server or API Gateway on premise instance so that you can manage the server or on-premise gateway from ARM. Each command contains information unique to your organization.
+
image:empty_servers-add_server_1st_srv-CORR.COMM-REAL-2.png[empty_servers-add_server_1st_srv-CORR.COMM-REAL-2]
+
. Run the displayed command (listed below) to add each Mule server, or API Gateway (that runs on a server). Running this command enables the Mule server or API Gateway to communicate with the Anypoint Runtime Manager. The key included in the `-H` parameter (partly redacted in the image above) is a token generated specifically for your Mule server or API Gateway to authenticate against Anypoint Runtime Manager.
+
To run this command:
+
.. In Anypoint Runtime Manager, click *Copy* to copy the displayed command to your clipboard.
.. Open a terminal in the server where your Mule server or API Gateway resides.
.. Go to the `bin` directory inside the Mule server or API Gateway root directory.
.. Paste the command into your terminal.
.. Substitute the last parameter, `server-name`, with the name you want for your server. In the example below, the name is `srv1`.
+
[source,java, linenums]
----
./amc_setup -H 17958da2-[redacted]---1942 srv1
----
+
[TIP]
If running Windows, substitute `amc_setup.bat` for `./amc_setup` (without `./`).
+
.. Press Enter to run the command.
. Check that the command output on your terminal states that the credentials extracted correctly:
. In the *Servers* screen of Anypoint Management Console, you should see that your server (named `srv1` in this example) is listed as *Created*:
+
image:srv1_created.png[srv1_created]

=== Start Mule or API Gateway

. Start your Mule server or API Gateway. To do so, change directory to the MuleSoft `bin` directory:
** For Mule Server: Run `./mule`
** For API Gateway: Run `./gateway` or `./gateway start`. The first command retains the gateway process in the terminal foreground; when you want to stop the gateway, press `CTRL-C`. If you are running API Gateway in the foreground, your terminal fills with startup messages.
+
. In the *Servers* screen of Anypoint Management Console, your server's status changes first to *Connected*, then to *Running:*
+
image:srv1_running.png[srv1_running]

At this point, you have successfully added server `srv1`.

==== About the amc_setup Command

The `amc_setup` command described above resides in `$MULE_HOME/bin`. If you do not run it from this directory, you have to either set the `MULE_HOME` environment variable before running the command, or use the `--mule-home` parameter:

[source,java, linenums]
----
/opt/mule-3.7.0/bin/amc_setup --mule-home /opt/mule-3.7.0 -H ...
----

The `amc_setup` script actually invokes the link:/runtime-manager/the-mule-agent[Mule agent] installation script, which has several useful parameters for configuring security and proxies. For details on the available options, see *Installation Options* in link:/mule-agent/v/1.1.1/installing-mule-agent[Installing Mule Agent].

==== About the Server Registration Token

The registration token provided by Anypoint Management Console (included in the command with the `-H` parameter) is specific to a single environment. For example, if you register a server in a QA environment by clicking *Add Server*, you get one token. However if you try to register into your *Production* environment by also clicking *Add Server,*  you get a different token. Tokens are specific to the environment in which you register a server. You can only copy and paste a token to register multiple Mules if you want all servers to be in the same environment.

=== Create a Server Group

A server group organizes servers into functional units such as for Accounting, Engineering, or Human Resources. The servers reside in your organization and are managed using the Runtime Manager. A server group is a set of servers that act as a single deployment target. An application runs on one or more of the servers as you indicate when you deploy an application.

Click *Create Group*:

image:CreateGroup.png[CreateGroup]

This displays:

image:AMC_CreateServerGroup.png[AMC_CreateServerGroup]

Give the server group a name, click the checkbox for each server to include in the group, and click *Create Group*.

=== Add a Server to a Server Group

If you want to add a server to a group that is currently running an existing application, you must first stop and and delete the application before you can add the server to a group.

From the Servers screen, click a server to view the additional menu, and click *Add Servers*:

image:AddServersToGroup.png[AddServersToGroup]

After you select servers to add to the group, click *Add to Group*:

image:AddToGroup.png[AddToGroup]

=== Stop an Application on a Server

You can stop an application that is currently running on a server from the drop-down menu in the Status menu:
