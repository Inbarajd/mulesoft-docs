CloudHub -- the Anypoint Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) solution from MuleSoft -- is integrated with the Anypoint Runtime Manager. Together, these components allow you to deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications in the cloud and on premises to servers, groups of servers, and clusters. You can create new APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on-premises applications with cloud services, manage servers and server groups on premises, and much more. With link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/download-and-launch-anypoint-studio[Anypoint Studio] – the user-friendly development tool – you can quickly build integration applications and deploy to CloudHub with just a few clicks. This guide helps you learn the basics, and get started developing your first application.
