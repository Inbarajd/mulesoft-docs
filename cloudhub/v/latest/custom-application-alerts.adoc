= Custom Application Alerts
:keywords: cloudhub, monitoring, api, arm, runtime manager

[NOTE]
Setting up alerts is currently only supported for apps deployed to CloudHub. Apps deployed through ARM to on premises servers don't support this feature.


== Prerequisites

Before going further, complete the link:/cloudhub/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World] example as this builds on top of it. In addition, you need to have "Mavenized" your project within Studio. For more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/using-maven-with-mule[Using Maven with Mule].

== Understanding Notifications

Notifications give you the ability to give visibility into business related events inside your application. For example, you can raise notifications when:

* Your application is unable to connect to a remote service
* An error occurs which requires human intervention, such as a problem with data mapping
* You want to create a summary of what occurred

In combination with link:/cloudhub/alerts-and-notifications[alerts], you can direct these notifications to different people to act on the alerts and fix the underlying problems.

This example illustrates:

* How to send business related events as notifications
* How to send errors as notifications
* How to send email alerts when notifications arrive

You can create alerts in the Runtime Manager with the software provided. If you want to create custom alerts, you need to get the CloudHub Connector and install it in Anypoint Studio.

== Installing the CloudHub Connector

To create notifications from your application, get the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/cloudhub-integration-connector[CloudHub connector] from Anypoint Exchange. This connector allows you to create custom notifications inside your flows and inside your exception strategies.

To access the CloudHub connector from Anypoint Studio, click *Help* > *Install New Software*. In *Work with*, click *Anypoint Connectors Update Site* and in the *Community* category, click *Mule CloudHub Connector Mule Studio Extension*. If this option is not listed, click *Help* > *Installation Details* and see if the connector was previously installed.

Click *Next*, *Next*, *I accept the terms of the license agreement*, *Finish*, and restart Studio.

== CloudHub Connector

Add and configure the CloudHub connector to our previous flow for "Hello World."

. In Anypoint Studio, find the *CloudHub* connector on the right menu and then drag and release it next to the *Set Payload* transformer:

+
. Open the configuration for the CloudHub connector. Create a new *Config Reference* for the connector by clicking the plus sign "*+*":
+

+
. Enter your credentials into the configuration and click *OK*:

+
. Set the properties like shown in the image below, making sure that you select the *Create notification* operation:

+
When your domain root is visited, the create-notification operation on the CloudHub connector creates a "Hello World!" notification message for the domain that the application is currently running on. When running on CloudHub, this connector authenticates automatically using a token from the environment so that it can be authenticated to post notifications to the Runtime Manager. When running locally, this operation sends the message to the INFO log level.

[IMPORTANT]
If you always want to create notifications on the Runtime Manager, even when running locally, you can use the <create-notification/>. This requires you to configure the connector with your username and password when running locally.

== Deploying Your Application

To deploy your application, click Deploy Application from the Applications menu. For more information, see link:/cloudhub/deploying-an-application-to-arm[Deploying an Application to ARM].

== Triggering Your Notification

Once your application is running, you can trigger the notification by simply going to your application's URL, for example: link:http://YOURAPP.cloudhub.io/hello-notification[http://YOURAPP.cloudhub.io/]. The page should display a `Hello World` message, and automatically create a new notification in your CloudHub console. Next, return to the Runtime Manager console and click the new notification indicator bell indicator in the upper-right to show the alert message:

== Creating a Custom Alert

Alerts allow you to send emails based on your application notifications. To create a custom alert for your application notification, click your application, and then click *Alerts* from the left menu.

In the *New Alert* dialog:

. Click *New alert*. 
. Enter an alert name, "Hello World".
. Optionally select your application name or leave the selection as "any"
. Select "custom application notification" as the event type
. Enter "Hello" as the text you want the notification to match
. Enter email addresses that you wish to email to
. Click *Create*. 

This creates your alert. Now, trigger your notification again by going to your application's URL, for example: `http://YOURAPP.cloudhub.io/`. You then receive an email with your notification in it!

== Creating a Notification Error

In addition to sending notifications from business events, you may want to send notifications when errors happen so they can be acted upon. To do this, you can use the CloudHub connector inside an catch exception strategy. To do this, add the following XML to your mule-config.xml:

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="create notification from exception">
    <inbound-endpoint address="http://localhost:${http.port}/create-notification-from-exception"/>
    <scripting:component>
        <scripting:script engine="groovy">
            throw new Exception("Could not connect to remote service.")
        </scripting:script>
    </scripting:component>
    <default-exception-strategy>
        <cloudhub:create-notification message="Error processing transaction." priority="ERROR"/>
    </default-exception-strategy>
</flow>
----

This flow throws an exception and creates a notification from that exception with the message "Error processing transaction." The exception stack trace for the flow is attached to the message. This can optionally be turned off using the attachStacktrace attribute.

As before, build and deploy your application, and then go to the URL: `http://YOURAPP.cloudhub.io/create-notification-from-exception`. Then return to the Runtime Manager console, and a notification pop-up appears in the top-right. Click the notifications link and the notification with the stack trace appears in the notifications list.

To view the whole stack trace and details, click "More..." and the whole message appears in a pop-up window:
