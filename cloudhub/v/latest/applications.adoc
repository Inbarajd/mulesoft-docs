An application is a Mule Application that is running on a Mule or API Gateway instance. The instance can be running in CloudHub, a server in an organization, or a group of servers. For server groups, an application deployed to the group runs on every server in the group. See <<Status States>> for possible values in the *Status* column.

From the *Applications* tab, by clicking an entry as shown, you can perform the following tasks:

* <<Deploy an Application>>
* <<Start, Stop, and Delete an Application>>
* <<Manage an Application>>


=== Deploy an Application

When you deploy an application, you set it to run in CloudHub, or in a server or server group in your organization. Use Anypoint Studio to create an application as described in link:/cloudhub/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub]. 

In the Applications screen, click *Deploy application*:

Specify:

* *Application Name* - An application name that consists of at least 3 characters in length with a maximum of 40 characters, containing only letters, numbers, or dashes, and cannot start with a dash.
+
* *Deployment Target* - From the drop-down list, click *CloudHub*, a server name, or a server group for where you want to deploy your application. Deploying to CloudHub implies deploying to the cloud, whereas by selecting a server or group you're deploying an application to one or more servers in your organization's data center.

If you click *CloudHub*, also supply:

=== Start, Stop, or Delete an Application

Click *Start*, *Stop*, or *Delete* as needed. The *Start* command restarts stopped applications, and if the application is Undeployed, sends the application's zip file to the server to start the application on the server.

=== Manage an Application

Managing an application lets you view a dashboard that lists Mule Messages, CPU use, memory use, and any of the categories of commands in the left navigation area, such as viewing logs, alerts, queues, change settings, debugging, and more.

To manage an application, click *Manage Application*:
