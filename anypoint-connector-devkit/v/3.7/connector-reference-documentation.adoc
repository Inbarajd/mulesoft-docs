This document describes how to write Javadoc comments in your connector code and generate readable documentation for your users.

toc::[]

== Introduction

After you build your connector, document its functionality to help customers use it effectively and reduce customer support and training costs.

Connector documentation usually consists of:

* Reference documentation (created by DevKit APIdoc; see <<Generating Documentation, Generating Documentation>>)
* README
* Release notes
* User guide including use cases - for examples see link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/packaging-your-connector-for-release#documenting-with-use-cases[Documenting with Use Cases]

Mule builds on link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc[Javadoc] to automate and simplify the creation of technical reference documentation for your connector, by adding a custom Javadoc Doclet and some DevKit-specific Java annotations.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you are familiar with Anypoint Studio and Javadoc. It also assumes that you have already developed and tested your connectors.

== Tags for Generating Documentation

The following sections describe the Javadoc tags and syntax that can be used to generate the documentation for your connector built using Anypoint DevKit.

=== Supported Javadoc Tags

The DevKit-supported Javadoc tags are described in this table and are used in examples throughout this document.
//TODO: screenshots or provide link to existing apidoc?
[width="100%",cols="20a,50a,30a",options="header"]
|===
|Tag|Description|Example
|`@link` | Provides an in-line link pointing to the documentation for the specified package if the fully qualified name is provided, otherwise the text after link is parsed as a string. | `{@link package.name.Class}`
|`@see` | provides an in-line link to a URL, for example to a page where a related class or method is described| If you want URLs inside your Javadoc comments to be parsed as hyperlinks, you can use the Javadoc tag `@see` to create an in-line link that will parse `{@see http://example.com}` +
or instead +
`{@see <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>}` to display the full URL. For a more detailed discussion of its usage, see link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#see
|`@api.doc`|Adds a new section to the documentation intended to provide a link to a service API’s documentation. You have the option whether or not to use html after the tag| `@api.doc <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_calls_create.htm">create()</a>`

|`@javadoc` | Can be used on the connector class, for example, `@javadoc.url`, followed by the name of a Java package name and the Javadoc URL. | See <<Annotation for Non-Java Data Types,Annotation for Non-Java Data Types>> for the code comment snippet.
|`@param` | Used underneath the description of a method. `@param` adds the parameter name and its description to the reference material. The description should be listed on the line below.| `@param ParamName`
|`@return` | Adds the description of the function's return type to the "Returns" section of the documentation.| `@return an instance of the data type returned`
|`@api.doc`
|===


[NOTE]
Documentation is not mandatory, however, unless you disable the Javadoc Check, errors display. To disable Javadoc Check and show errors as warnings, right-click your project, and click *Anypoint Connector* > *Disable Javadoc check*.

=== Connector Metadata: @Connector and @Author

Each class annotated with `@Connector` should have a class-level Javadoc comment with a high-level overview of the extensions. This may also include the `@author` annotation.

[source, java, linenums]
----
/**
 * CMIS (Content Management Interoperability Services) is a standard for improving interoperability between ECM systems.
 *
 * @author MuleSoft, Inc.
 */
@ReconnectOn(exceptions = CMISConnectorConnectionException.class)
@Connector(name = "cmis", schemaVersion = "1.1", friendlyName = "CMIS")
public class CMISConnector implements CMISFacade {
...
----

=== Documenting @Configurable Attributes

`@Configurable` attributes of your connector can be documented with a Javadoc comment that briefly explains the attribute.

[source, java, linenums]
----
/**
 * The username to access the service
 */
 @Configurable
 private String username;

/**
 * The password to access the service
 */
 @Configurable
 private String password;

/**
 * The API endpoint;
 */
 @Configurable
 private String apiEndpoint;
----

The `@Default` annotation puts the value between parentheses under the "Default Value" column in the row corresponding to the attribute. The default value for `host` is `localhost:27017` in this example:

[source,java,linenums]
----
/**
 * A list of MongoDB instances, with the format <code>host:port</code>, separated by commas.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Example: 127.0.0.1:27017, 192.168.1.2:27017
 * </pre>
 *
 */
@Configurable
    @Default("localhost:27017")
    @FriendlyName("Servers (host:port)")
    @Placement(group = "Connection")
    private String host;
----

image:host-attr.png[host-attr]

=== Documenting @Processor Methods and Parameters

Each method annotated with @Processor or @Source (for streaming APIs) should have a Javadoc comment that includes the following:

* A description of the use of the method
* A pointer to an XML code sample for the element in Mule (described below)
//TODO: confirm this is not necessary
* For each parameter of the method, a Javadoc `@param` tag, with a description of the parameter

If the method has a return type other than `void`, a Javadoc `@return` tag with a description of the return value.

[source, java, linenums]
----
/**
 * Inserts a document into a collection, setting its id if necessary.
 *
 *
 * @param collection
 *            the name of the collection where the given document should be inserted.
 * @param document
 *            a {@link Document} instance.
 * @return the id that was just inserted
 */
@Processor
public String insertDocument(final String collection, @RefOnly @Default("#[payload]") final Document document) {
    Validate.notNull(collection);
    Validate.notNull(document);
    return config.getClient().insertObject(collection, document);
}
----
=== Linking to External Javadoc Resources
//TODO: is this title ok, or is this annotation for native Java types too?

To embed a link in your documentation to external Javadoc reference material, you may use a `@link` placeholder within your comments provided that the fully qualified name of the class be specified, for example, `{@link org.bson.Document}` *and* the reference to the external third-party Javadoc resource after the `@javadoc.url` tag above the connector class as described in <<Annotation for Non-Java Data Types,Annotation for Non-Java Data Types>>, otherwise the URL will not be created because the package for that type will not be found.

//TODO: Juan, can you provide an example where the fully qualified path is given after @link, in the format {@link package.class#member label}?

----
/**
 * Returns a CMIS object from the repository and puts it into the cache.
 * <p/>
 *
 * @param path Path of the object to retrieve
 * @return a {@link CmisObject} instance
 */
@Processor
public CmisObject getObjectByPath(@NotNull String path) {
    return facade.getObjectByPath(path);
}
----

The base URL to the reference material for an extension's data type must be created by annotating the *connector class* with the Javadoc tag `@javadoc.url`.

* Then add a space, and enter the name of the Java package, for example, `org.bson`.
* Finally, put the Java extension's URL between brackets *[ ]*. This URL *must* be a Javadoc URL. See the following example from the MongoDB connector:

[source,java,linenums]
----
/**
*
* @author Mulesoft
* @javadoc.url org.bson[https://api.mongodb.org/java/3.1/];
* @javadoc.url com.mongodb[https://api.mongodb.org/java/3.1/];
*/
public class MongoCloudConnector {
...
----

DevKit concatenates the base URL for the MongoDB Java API, the path to the particular package, and the specific class to form a proper URL.

image:apidoc-mongo-document-attr.png[apidoc-mongo-document-attr]

Clicking *Document* from the documentation shown above would direct the user to the reference material for this class: `https://api.mongodb.org/java/3.1/org/bson/Document.html`.

=== XML Code Samples File

The examples file must be stored in the `/doc` folder and adhere to this structure:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-a) -->
// example here
<!-- END_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-a) -->
<!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-b) -->
// example here
<!-- END_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-b) -->
...
----

Here is an example from the CMIS connector's `xml.sample` file:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(cmis:getObjectByPath) -->
        <cmis:get-object-by-path path="/mule-cloud-connector" config-ref="config" />
<!-- END_INCLUDE(cmis:getObjectByPath) -->
----

[NOTE]
The DevKit ApiDoc can generate more than one example from the `xml.sample` file for the same connector operation. Of course, the example must follow the same "include" tag structure above. As of DevKit 3.8.0, the `@sample.xml` tag is *NOT* supported.

== Generating Documentation

Documentation can be previewed by right-clicking your project in the Package Explorer, then selecting *Anypoint Connector* > *Preview Documentation*.

[IMPORTANT]
You must have *DevKit 3.8.0* and have *JDK 7 or higher* enabled to access the updated documentation features described here. Ensure the appropriate version of DevKit is referenced in the pom.xml file, and likewise for the JDK used by the system.

When you generate documentation for your connector (*Project* > *Generate Javadoc*), DevKit automatically creates both an *HTML* file and an link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/#what-is-asciidoc[AsciiDoc] file that serve as a user-friendly reference for the Javadoc comments you have added within your code explaining connector methods and attributes.

//TODO: Juani/Paulo, please confirm/adjust wording above to detail the basic process of how users generate docs and whether connector build process will create docs automatically

Alternatively, you can navigate to the connector's root directory and execute the following Maven command to generate the documentation:

----
mvn clean compile -DgenerateApidocs
----

//TODO: specify the command to use since this above did not work for JDK7
//what worked was: mvn clean compile -Dgenerate.apidocs

The generated documentation can be found in the `target/apidocs` directory in your connector folder. Open the file `connectorname-apidoc.html` to show the fully generated documentation in the browser.

As you build out your connector, perform a review of the generated documentation to ensure that the contents are sane and correct. If you find the generated documentation insufficient, you can always include more detail in the Javadoc comments in your code.
