= MuleSoft Certified Connector License Management
:keywords: connector, devkit, license, key, keygen, partner, paid

== Introduction

With *DevKit 3.8*, MuleSoft Certified Connector partners/developers, referred to here also as "partners", can manage their connector’s license natively with DevKit before the connector is packaged for release, ensuring only the partner's paid customers are using the connector.

Partners that have built a MuleSoft Certified Connector can give potential customers the chance to build a Mule application with their connector and test it on the Mule ESB bundled with Anypoint Studio. However, upon deploying the Mule application with the connector, customers are prompted for the partner's generated key ensuring they possess a valid license from the partner.

== Why Use This Licensing Mechanism

Using a MuleSoft-generated key ensures only the MuleSoft partner's paid customers have complete access to the paid version of the connector. Users who would like to test out the connector before purchasing it would be able to experiment with the connector in design in Anypoint Studio and run their application in Studio's embedded Mule runtime.

In trying to deploy this sample connector on CloudHub or Mule ESB On-Prem, you see a pop-up message requesting a valid license.

== Before Submitting Your Connector For Certification

Before submitting the connector to MuleSoft for certification, the prospective certified connector partner should complete these steps:
//todo: see above: "should" or "must"?

. Include the following information for MuleSoft to use before generating a partner key and keystore.
.. *Vendor Name*, *Contact Email*, *Contact Message*, *Connector Name*
. The partner then adjusts the connector project code accordingly by applying the `@RequiresEntitlement` annotation, and entering values for all requested attributes
//todo: need information about the required attributes (@Target(value={TYPE}), @Retention(value=SOURCE), @Documented) ???
.. The *provider name* is required to match the name of the `.key` file given by Mule. For example, if MuleSoft generated a vendor key using the name “Splunk.key”, then the provider name has to be “Splunk”.
//TODO: where does the vendor see this "provider name" bit?
.. Put the given `.key` file under the `src/main/resources` or `src/main/resources/license` folder in the connector’s project directory
. The partner uses the key in the DLT to produce a license for the connector customer, which should then be provided to the respective customer.

== Developing a Mule Application with a Licensed Connector

For the customer to validate their working connector license, the customer must make their license (`.lic`) file available through either the Mule application or the Mule server.

=== License File in the Mule Application

Once the customer has already bought a license for the connector, the `.lic` file provided to the customer by the partner/vendor can be placed either:

* under `src/main/resources` in the application (developed in Studio) or,
* under `app/classes` if the application has already been unpacked and deployed on the server.

=== License File in the Mule Server

Instead of storing the license in the application, it can be placed instead in the `conf/` folder of the Mule server.

[NOTE]
This is the recommended approach if multiple applications require the same license.
