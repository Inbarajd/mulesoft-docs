= Operation Filtering
:keywords: operation filtering, soap connect, session management

For a particular `ServiceDefinition`, the developer is able to filter out (that is, hide from the connector user) some operations that are declared in the WSDL file.

This filtering is necessary in order to exclude login/logout operations from the operations dropdown exposed to the app developer.
//todo: why login/logout operations?

The set of excluded operations will be bundled in the definitions that hold the operation names to be removed from the metadata key retrieval.

@WsdlServiceRetriever
    public ServiceDefinition getServiceDefinition() {
           ServiceDefinition service = new DefaultServiceDefinition(
                          "ServiceId", "tshirt", "tshirt.wsdl","TshirtService","TshirtServicePort");

           service.setExclusions(Arrays.asList("login", "logout"));

            // Exclusions can also be set as:
            // service.excludeOperation(“myUnwantedOp”);

            return service;
