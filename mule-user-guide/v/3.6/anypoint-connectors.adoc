*Anypoint Connectors(TM)* facilitate easy integration of your Mule applications with third-party APIs and standard integration protocols. Use connectors within your application's flows to send and receive data using a protocol or specific API. 

Anypoint Connectors are automatically bundled with Anypoint Studio, and there is a large library of additional connectors available for download in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector[Anypoint Exchange]. You can also create a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/publishing-and-consuming-apis-with-mule[REST or SOAP API connector], or create your own connectors using link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8[Anypoint Connector DevKit]. For more information on integration solutions, see the http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/cloud-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] product site.

You can "test drive" a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/anypoint-exchange#installing-a-connector-from-anypoint-exchange[Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].  

Import additional connectors into your Studio instance, or create applications using connectors outside of Studio by adding them as Maven dependencies or including connector libraries with your project.

For more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/connectors-user-guide[Connectors User Guide].

The following shows the relationship of connectors to other components in the Anypoint Platform:

== Connector Categories

Connectors fall into one of the following categories:

MuleSoft or members of the Mule community write and maintain the https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&filters=Community&sortBy=name[Community connectors]. Connectors built by the community or MuleSoft are generally open-source, although each package may vary. Partner-built connectors may not be open-source. Contact the partner directly for more information.  You do not need any special account or license to use a Community connector.

== Installing Connectors

Install connectors using https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&sortBy=name[Anypoint Exchange]. For more information, see /mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/anypoint-exchange#installing-a-connector-from-anypoint-exchange[Installing Connectors from Anypoint Exchange].

== Connector Support

MuleSoft supports all connectors–the level of support depends on the connector.

*Note*: MuleSoft does not support the code of any underlying third-party API (if relevant), only the wrapper that constitutes the connector itself. 

See: https://www.mulesoft.com/downloads/legal/mule-esb-support-maintenance-term[MuleSoft Connector Support Policy]

There are four levels of connectors: Premium, Select, Standard, Community.

=== Support for Premium and Select Connectors

https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&filters=Premium&sortBy=name[Premium] and https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&filters=Select&sortBy=name[Select] connector customers have benefit of MuleSoft Customer Support for troubleshooting and diagnosis of any issue encountered with their Premium or Select connector. This includes configuration assistance, connector updates, patch fixes for critical issues, and enhancements via scheduled release cycles.

=== Support for Standard and Community Connectors

https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&filters=Standard&sortBy=name[Standard] and https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&filters=Community&sortBy=name[Community] connector customers have access to Customer Support who troubleshoot to ensure that all licensed components of the platform are working as designed. If the Standard or Community connector is the source of the issue and assistance is required to modify or alter the connector, MuleSoft Professional Services or an accredited MuleSoft Partner can be engaged by contacting their MuleSoft Account Manager.

=== Getting Support for a Connector

If you need help with a connector, search the http://forum.mulesoft.org/mulesoft/products/mulesoft_anypoint_connectors[Anypoint Connector section of the forum] for solutions and ideas. MuleSoft monitors the forum and addresses bugs reported there. 

If you are a CloudHub or Enterprise subscriber and you cannot find an answer in the forum, you can file a support ticket in the http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[customer portal].
